## üèõÔ∏è Linux History

> **"The Linux kernel is the beating heart of all Linux distributions."**  
> ‚Äî Linus Torvalds

Linux was created in **1991** by **Linus Torvalds** after becoming frustrated with the limitations of MINIX. Inspired by the GNU Project launched by **Richard Stallman** in 1983, Torvalds built the **Linux kernel**, which, when combined with GNU components, formed a complete operating system.

### Key Points:
- **Unix** was developed at **AT&T's Bell Labs** in 1969.
- **Unix‚Äôs** proprietary nature led to the development of free alternatives like GNU and Linux.
- **Linux** is now widely used in **servers, desktops, and embedded systems**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Linux Distributions

Linux distributions, commonly called **distros**, are variations of Linux that cater to different users and purposes. Below are some of the most popular distributions, each tailored to different user needs.

| Distro         | Target Audience  | Features                                         |
|----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Ubuntu**     | It is for Beginners         | It is very Easy to use and it has strong community support            |
| **Fedora**     | Mainly used by Developers        | it is a Cutting-edge software backed by Red Hat         |
| **Kali Linux** | it is used by Security Professionals     | It Focuses on penetration testing and security auditing tools   |
| **Debian**   | it is used by Stability Seekers and also in servers | It has Rock-solid stability, large software repositories   |
| **CentOS** | Used in Enterprise/Servers  | It is Stable and free, upstream source from Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)     |

### Key Differences Between Linux Distributions: 
 **Ubuntu:** This is one of the easiest versions of Linux to use, especially for beginners. It has a big community that helps you when you're stuck, and it gets regular updates. You also get access to lots of software.  
 
 **Fedora:** If you're a developer or someone who likes working with the latest tech, Fedora is perfect. It‚Äôs always up-to-date with the newest features and is supported by Red Hat, a big name in the tech world.  
 
 **Debian:** Known for being super reliable and stable, Debian is often used on servers where things need to work smoothly for a long time without problems.  
 
 **CentOS:** This version is made for businesses and servers. It‚Äôs known for being stable and offers long-term support, which means fewer updates but more reliability.
